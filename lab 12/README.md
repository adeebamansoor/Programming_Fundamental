# Functions & Menu-Driven Programs in C++ — Lab Tasks

This repository contains **C++ programs** focusing on **functions, loops, and menu-driven programming**.  
These tasks help students understand **function usage, user-defined operations, and practical applications** in real-world scenarios.

---

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Using Library Functions**
This program takes a number as input and calculates the following using C++ library functions (`<cmath>`):
- Square Root  
- Absolute Value  
- Sin  
- Cos  
- Power of 3  

#### Concepts Used:
- `<cmath>` library  
- Built-in mathematical functions  

---

### **Task 2: Function with Void Return Type (Greeting Message)**
This program defines a function that displays a **welcome message**.  
The function does **not take any parameters** and prints:
> "Hello, Welcome to C++ Functions!"  

#### Concepts Used:
- Void functions  
- Function call from `main()`

---

### **Task 3: Function with If-Else Statement (Even or Odd)**
This program defines a function to determine whether a number is **even or odd**.  
- Input: integer  
- Output: "Even" or "Odd"  

The function is called multiple times from `main()` with different values.

#### Concepts Used:
- Functions with parameters  
- Conditional statements (if-else)

---

### **Task 4: Function with Loop (Factorial Calculation)**
This program defines a function to compute the **factorial of a number** using a loop.  
- Input: integer  
- Output: factorial of the number  

#### Concepts Used:
- Loops inside functions  
- Return type function  
- Multiplication logic

---

### **Task 5: Menu-Driven Calculator Using Functions**
This program acts as a **simple calculator** using functions for each arithmetic operation:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  

#### Features:
- Menu for selecting operations  
- Separate functions for each operation  
- Handles multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit  
- Input validation for division by zero  

---

### **Task 6: Menu-Driven Restaurant Billing System**
This program calculates the **total bill** for a restaurant order.

#### Features:
- Displays a menu with at least 5 food items and prices  
- Allows the user to select items and enter quantity  
- Uses functions to calculate:
  - Cost of selected items  
  - Final bill including **10% tax/service charge**  
- Allows multiple orders until the user exits  

#### Functions Used:
- Function to display menu  
- Function to calculate item cost (price × quantity)  
- Function to calculate final bill with tax
