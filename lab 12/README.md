# Functions & Menu-Driven Programs in C++ — Lab Tasks

This repository contains **C++ programs** focusing on **functions, loops, and menu-driven programming**.  
These tasks help students understand **function usage, user-defined operations, and practical applications** in real-world scenarios.

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Using Library Functions**
This program takes a number as input and calculates the following using C++ library functions (`<cmath>`):
- Square Root  
- Absolute Value  
- Sin  
- Cos  
- Power of 3  

#### Concepts Used:
- `<cmath>` library  
- Built-in mathematical functions

### **Task 2: Function with Void Return Type (Greeting Message)**
This program defines a function that displays a **welcome message**.  
The function does **not take any parameters** and prints:
> "Hello, Welcome to C++ Functions!"  

#### Concepts Used:
- Void functions  
- Function call from `main()`
