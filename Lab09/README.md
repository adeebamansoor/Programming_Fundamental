# While Loop & Menu-Driven Programs — C++ Lab Tasks

This repository contains **C++ programs based on while loops and menu-driven logic**.  
These tasks focus on repetition, input validation, and real-life problem scenarios using C++.

---

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Print Numbers from 1 to N**
This program asks the user to enter a number **N** and prints all numbers from **1 to N** using a loop.

#### Concepts Used:
- User input
- While loop
- Sequential output

---

### **Task 2: Multiplication Table**
This program displays the **multiplication table** of a number entered by the user.

#### Example:
If the user enters `5`, the program prints:
5 × 1 = 5  
5 × 2 = 10  
…and so on.

#### Concepts Used:
- While loop
- Arithmetic operations

---

### **Task 3: Input Validation Using While Loop**
This program repeatedly asks the user to enter a **positive number**.  
If the user enters **zero or a negative number**, an error message is displayed and input is requested again.

The program terminates only when a valid positive number is entered.

#### Concepts Used:
- While loop
- Input validation
- Conditional statements

---

### **Task 4: Sum of First Five Natural Numbers**
This program calculates the sum of the first five natural numbers  
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) using a **while loop** and displays the result.

#### Concepts Used:
- While loop
- Accumulator variable

---

### **Task 5: Menu-Driven Banking System**
This is a **menu-driven program** for a simple banking system.  
The system starts with a **default balance of $1000** and continues to run until the user exits.

#### Menu Options:
1. Deposit Money  
2. Withdraw Money  
3. Check Balance  
4. Exit  

#### Features:
- Prevents withdrawal if balance is insufficient
- Displays error messages for invalid choices
- Uses while loop to keep showing the menu

---

### **Task 6: Password Authentication System**
This program prompts the user to enter a **password**.  
If the password is incorrect, the user is asked to try again until the correct password is entered.

#### Concepts Used:
- While loop
- String comparison
- Authentication logic

---

### **Task 7: Restaurant Ordering System**
This program simulates a **restaurant ordering system**.

#### Features:
- Main menu and sub-menu for food items
- Fixed prices (as per District Food Authority)
- User can order multiple items
- User can specify quantity (e.g., 2 KG Chicken Karahi)
- Calculates total bill
- Allows ordering until the user chooses to stop

#### Concepts Used:
- Nested menus
- While loop
- Bill calculation
- Real-world problem solving
