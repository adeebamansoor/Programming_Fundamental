# Array Programs in C++ — Lab Tasks

This repository contains **basic C++ programs related to arrays**.  
These programs help in understanding array initialization, traversal, calculations, and finding specific elements.

---

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Initialize and Print an Array**
This program initializes an array of **five integers** and then traverses the array to print all its elements.

#### Concepts Used:
- Array initialization
- Loop traversal
- Output formatting

---

### **Task 2: Print an Array in Reverse Order**
This program asks the user to enter **N integers** into an array and then prints the array elements in **reverse order**.

#### Concepts Used:
- User input
- Arrays
- Reverse traversal using loops

---

### **Task 3: Calculate Sum and Average of Array Elements**
This program initializes an array of integers and calculates:
- The **sum** of all elements
- The **average** of the elements  

The results are displayed on the screen.

#### Concepts Used:
- Arrays
- While / for loop
- Arithmetic operations

---

### **Task 4: Find the Length of an Array**
This program initializes an array of integers and calculates the **size (length)** of the array using the `sizeof()` operator.

#### Concepts Used:
- Arrays
- sizeof operator
- Array properties

---

### **Task 5: Find the Largest Number in an Array**
This program prompts the user to input **N integers** into an array and then finds and displays the **largest number** present in the array.

#### Concepts Used:
- Arrays
- Comparison logic
- Loop traversal

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of these tasks is to:
- Understand the concept of **arrays in C++**
- Practice **array traversal**
- Perform **calculations using arrays**
- Learn how to find **maximum values and array size**

---

## ▶ How to Run
1. Open the program file in **Dev-C++** or any C++ IDE  
2. Compile and run the program  
3. Enter input as instructed on the screen
