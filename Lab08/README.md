# Switch Statement Practice — C++ Lab Tasks

This repository contains **C++ programs based on switch statements**.  
Each task is designed to improve decision-making logic, user input handling, and real-world problem solving using C++.

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Simple Calculator Using Switch Statement**
This program acts as a basic calculator.  
It takes **two numbers** and an **operator (+, -, *, /)** as input from the user and performs the corresponding operation using a `switch` statement.

#### Features:
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Displays an error message for invalid operators
- Demonstrates basic arithmetic and switch-case usage

### **Task 2: Day of the Week Program**
This program takes an **integer (1–7)** as input and displays the corresponding **day of the week** using a `switch` statement.

#### Mapping:
- 1 → Monday  
- 2 → Tuesday  
- 3 → Wednesday  
- 4 → Thursday  
- 5 → Friday  
- 6 → Saturday  
- 7 → Sunday  

If the input is not between **1 and 7**, the program displays an appropriate error message.

### **Task 3: Area Calculator for Different Shapes**
This program calculates the **area of different shapes** based on user selection using a `switch` statement.

#### Shape Options:
- 1 → Circle  
- 2 → Rectangle  
- 3 → Triangle  

The program asks the user to enter required dimensions (radius, length & width, base & height) and then calculates and displays the area.

---

### **Task 4: Currency Converter**
This program acts as a **currency converter** using a `switch` statement.  
The user selects a conversion option and enters the amount.

#### Conversion Options:
- USD to PKR  
- USD to INR  
- USD to Euros  

The program calculates and displays the converted amount based on predefined exchange rates.

### **Task 5: Shopping System with Categories and Discounts**
This program simulates a **shopping system** where a customer selects a category, chooses an item, enters quantity, and receives a generated invoice.

#### Categories & Items:
**Electronics**
- Laptop ($1000)  
- Smartphone ($700)  
- Headphones ($150)  

**Clothing**
- Jacket ($120)  
- T-shirt ($40)  
- Jeans ($60)  

**Groceries**
- Milk (1 Liter – $2)  
- Bread (1 Loaf – $3)  
- Eggs (1 Dozen – $5)  

#### Discount Policy:
- Below $100 → No discount  
- $100 – $500 → 10% discount  
- Above $500 → 20% discount  

The system calculates the total bill, applies discount if applicable, and prints the final invoice.
