# 📚 Library Management System (Console-Based)

## Project Overview

This project is a **Console-Based Library Management System** developed in **C++** as part of the **Programming Fundamentals (1st Semester)** course. The system helps manage library records such as books, issuing, returning, and tracking availability using arrays, functions, and basic logic.

The project is designed to strengthen core programming concepts like **loops, functions, arrays, input validation, and conditional logic**, while also introducing basic system design.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To understand how a real-world system (library) can be modeled using programming logic
* To practice modular programming using functions
* To apply input validation and structured program flow
* To improve problem-solving and logical thinking skills

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Librarian Login System

* Password-protected access
* Prevents unauthorized usage

### ➕ Add New Book

* Add book ID, name, category, and quantity
* Automatically initializes issue and return data

### 📋 Display All Books (Table Format)

* Shows complete book record
* Displays:

  * Book ID
  * Name
  * Category
  * Total copies
  * Issued copies
  * Available copies
  * Student roll number
  * Issue & return dates
* Proper alignment without using `setw`

### 🔍 Search Book

* Search book using Book ID
* Displays book details if found
* Shows availability status

### 📤 Issue Book

* Issue a book to a student
* Stores student roll number and issue date
* Prevents issuing if no copies are available

### 📥 Return Book

* Return issued book
* Calculates fine based on late days
* Updates issued quantity and clears student record

### ⭐ Popular Books Tracking

* Tracks how many times each book is issued
* Marks books as **Popular** if issued frequently

### 📊 Total Library Summary

* Displays:

  * Total number of books
  * Total issued books
  * Total available books

## 🧠 Programming Concepts Used

### Core Concepts

* Variables and Constants
* Conditional Statements (`if-else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
* Functions & Function Prototypes
* Arrays (1D)
* Strings and `length()` function

### Advanced Basics

* Input Validation (string-based numeric check)
* Modular Programming
* Linear Search Algorithm
* Console formatting using tabs
* Use of global variables

### System Concepts

* Menu-driven program
* User authentication
* Record management

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Language:** C++
* **Compiler:** GCC / Dev-C++ / Code::Blocks
* **Platform:** Windows (uses `windows.h` for color & screen control)

---

## 📂 Project Structure

* Global constants and variables
* Function prototypes
* Main function (menu-driven logic)
* Feature-based functions:

  * addBook()
  * displayBooks()
  * searchBook()
  * issueBook()
  * returnBook()
  * showPopularBooks()
  * totalLibrarySummary()

---

## ⚙ How the Program Works (Flow)

1. Librarian logs in using password
2. Main menu is displayed
3. User selects an option
4. Corresponding function executes
5. User returns to menu or exits

---

## 📌 Limitations

* Uses arrays instead of files (data is lost on exit)
* Single student record per book
* Windows-only due to `windows.h`

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Convert to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
* Add **file handling** for data persistence
* Support multiple students per book
* Add date validation
* Create GUI or web-based version

---

## 👨‍🎓 Academic Information

* **Course:** Programming Fundamentals
* **Semester:** 1st Semester
* **Project Type:** Console Application

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This Library Management System is a strong foundational project that demonstrates practical use of programming fundamentals. It provides a solid base for future upgrades into **OOP-based**, **file-handling**, or **database-driven** systems and prepares students for real-world problem solving in software development.
