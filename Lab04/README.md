#  Ternary Operator Tasks

This document contains three programming tasks designed to help you understand and apply the ternary operator in C++.
Each task must be solved without using if-else statements.

# Task 1: Determine Even or Odd Number
## Objective

Write a program that:

-Takes an integer input from the user.

-Checks whether the number is even or odd using the ternary operator.

-Displays the output in the correct format


# Task 2: Age Group Classification
## Objective

Write a program that classifies a person’s age using the ternary operator into:

-Age	Category
-Less than 13	Child
-13–19	Teenager
-20 or greater	Adult


# Task 3: Banking App
## Objective

-Create a program that determines:

-Account Type

-Special Offer Eligibility

Account Type Rules
-Balance	Account Type
-Less than $100	Low Balance
-$100 – $500	Standard Account
-Greater than $500	Premium Account
-Special Offer Eligibility

### A customer is eligible for a special offer if:

-Their balance is greater than $200, AND

-They are a loyal customer (loyalty = 1)

-Otherwise, they are not eligible.


# Conclusion

These tasks help you practice using the ternary operator in real scenarios, improving your understanding
