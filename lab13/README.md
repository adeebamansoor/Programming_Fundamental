# Pointers in C++ — Lab Tasks

This repository contains **C++ programs related to pointers**.  
These tasks cover basic and advanced pointer operations including **dereferencing, pointer arithmetic, function pointers, nullptr, and void pointers**.

---

## 🧪 Lab Tasks Overview

### **Task 1: Display Value Using Pointer**
This program declares an **integer variable** and a **pointer** that stores its address.  
It uses the **dereferencing operator (`*`)** to display the value of the variable.

#### Concepts Used:
- Pointer declaration
- Dereferencing operator
- Memory address storage

---

### **Task 2: Modify Variable Using Pointer**
This program declares an **integer variable** and a pointer pointing to it.  
The value of the variable is **modified using the pointer**, and the updated value is displayed.

#### Concepts Used:
- Pointer to variable
- Dereferencing to change value
- Memory manipulation

---

### **Task 3: Access Array Elements Using Pointer Arithmetic**
This program declares an **array of integers** and uses a pointer to **access and display each element**.  
Pointer arithmetic (`*(ptr + i)`) is used to traverse the array.

#### Concepts Used:
- Arrays and pointers
- Pointer arithmetic
- Loop traversal using pointers

---

### **Task 4: Swap Two Numbers Using Pointer Function**
This program defines a function to **swap two numbers** using pointers as function arguments.  
- Displays values **before and after swapping**.

#### Concepts Used:
- Function with pointer parameters
- Swap logic using dereferencing
- Passing by reference via pointers

---

### **Task 5: Check for nullptr**
This program declares a pointer and initializes it to `nullptr`.  
- Checks whether the pointer is null  
- Displays appropriate messages:  
  - "Pointer is null" if it points to nothing  
  - "Pointer points to address ..." if it is not null

#### Concepts Used:
- `nullptr` keyword
- Pointer validation
- Memory safety

---

### **Task 6: Using Void Pointer**
This program declares a **void pointer** and assigns it the address of an integer variable.  
- The void pointer is **cast to the correct type** before dereferencing to display the value.

#### Concepts Used:
- Void pointers (`void*`)
- Type casting before dereferencing
- Generic pointer usage

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of these tasks is to:
- Understand **pointer basics** in C++  
- Learn **dereferencing and pointer arithmetic**  
- Use pointers in **functions and arrays**  
- Handle **null and void pointers** safely  
- Apply pointers in practical programming scenarios
