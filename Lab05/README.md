# Lab 5 – Programming Fundamentals

This lab contains 8 tasks designed to practice **conditional statements, and basic problem-solving skills**.

---

## Tasks

### 1. Check Positive Number
Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is positive.  
- If the number is positive, print: `"The number is positive."`  
- **Use only `if` statements**.

### 2. Check Even Number
Write a program to determine if a given integer is even.  
- Display `"The number is even"` if the condition is met.  
- **Use only `if` statements**.

### 3. Find Largest of Three Numbers
Write a program to find the largest of three numbers entered by the user.  
- Compare the numbers using only `if` statements and print the largest one.

### 4. Determine Student Grade
Write a program that takes a student’s marks (out of 100) and determines the grade:  
- 90 and above: **A+**  
- 80–89: **A**  
- 70–79: **B**  
- 60–69: **C**  
- Below 60: **Fail**  
- **Use only `if` statements**.

### 5. Traffic Signal Simulation
Write a program that simulates a traffic signal system.  
- User enters a color: `R` (Red), `G` (Green), or `Y` (Yellow).  
- Program responds:
  - Red: Stop  
  - Green: Go  
  - Yellow: Slow Down  
- **Use only `if` statements**.

### 6. ATM Simulation
Write a program to simulate a basic ATM machine:  
- Ask the user for account balance and withdrawal amount.  
- If withdrawal ≤ balance, deduct and display remaining balance.  
- If withdrawal > balance, display `"Insufficient balance."`  
- **Use `if-else` statements**.

### 7. Loan Eligibility Check
Write a program to check if a person is eligible for a loan:  
- Minimum salary: $25,000.  
- If experience > 5 years, eligible even with $20,000 salary.  
- **Use `if-else` statements**.

### 8. Employee Payroll Management System
Design a program to calculate an employee’s net salary:  
- **Basic Salary and Grades**:
  - Grade A: $50,000  
  - Grade B: $30,000  
  - Grade C: $20,000  
- **Bonuses**:
  - Years of service ≥ 10 → 10% bonus  
  - Years of service 5–9 → 5% bonus  
  - Years of service < 5 → No bonus  
- **Tax Deductions**:
  - Gross > $40,000 → 20% tax  
  - $30,000 ≤ Gross ≤ $40,000 → 10% tax  
  - Gross < $30,000 → No tax  
- **Net Salary Calculation**:


- **Use only `if` statements** for all conditions.

## Lab 5 Objectives

- Practice **conditional statements** (`if` and `if-else`).  
- Compare numbers and check conditions using logical operators.  
- Learn to simulate **real-world problems** like ATM, loan eligibility, and payroll.  
- Improve **problem-solving and programming logic skills**.  
- Understand how to calculate values step by step using **basic programming constructs**.
